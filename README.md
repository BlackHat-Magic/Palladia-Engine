# Palladia Engine

(Formerly Asmadi)

A Simple, ECS-based game engine written in C using SDL3's GPU API

</div>

## Overview

The Asmadi Palladia Engine is a game engine using SDL3's GPU API to create 3D accelerated graphical applications with Vulkan (and soon hopefully WebGPU). I might add Metal support if I feel like it.

### Goals

The main goal with this project was to learn graphics programming. In game development, I often find myself knowing exactly what I want the code to look like, but unsure of how to tell the game engine how to do that. So, I figured that several hundred to several thousand hours of trial and error should save me about thirty minutes of reading the Godot Documentation.
